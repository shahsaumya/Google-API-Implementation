# Restaurant Picker Web App
My first venture into web development, this web app allows users to choose the cuisine of food in a restaurant they'd like to eat at.

The web app also displayes results of the given restaurants such as contact number, price, menu etc. It uses Django as a backend with integration of Google Places API.

## Tech Stack
- **Django Backend**
- **HTML, CSS and Bootstrap**
- **Google Places API Integration**
